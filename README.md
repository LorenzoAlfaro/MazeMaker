# MazeMaker

## Introduction

This is a good example of what happens when you are bored. Being inspired by **Deep Rock Galactic** I asked myself:

Wouldn't it be cool if we had procedurally generated maps in StarCraft Broodwar?

Yes, but at what cost?

## Technical dificulties

Maps are stored in a propietary format. I overcame this buy looking into a similar project.

TODO: URL to VB6 tool that takes images and creates maps with the tileset matching the image.

TODO: URL to MPQ wiki

Now we are in the world of editing binaries. That is when you know you have gone too deep.

And digging into old VB6 souce code. Yay!


## The results

Some very crazy looking maps that are basically mazes.

TODO: Insert pictures.
